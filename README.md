Google Play Store Data Cleaning & Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset of Google Play Store apps to extract meaningful insights. The dataset includes various attributes such as app category, reviews, ratings, number of installs, and pricing.

The goal was to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data to uncover trends and patterns that could help understand the mobile app market better.

⚙️ Key Steps in the Project
🔹 1. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values appropriately to avoid biases.
Fixed incorrect data types (e.g., converting "Installs" and "Price" columns to numeric values).
Standardized formats (removing unnecessary characters from numeric fields).
Detected and removed outliers to ensure accurate analysis.
🔹 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed app ratings and their distribution.
Identified top categories with the highest number of reviews.
Examined app pricing trends and revenue potential.
Grouped apps by category and installs to find patterns in popularity.
🔹 3. Insights & Visualizations
Used Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization.
Generated plots to show relationships between installs, reviews, and pricing.
Compared free vs. paid apps in terms of popularity and ratings.
📊 Results & Key Findings
The majority of apps are free, with only a small percentage being paid.
Certain categories receive significantly higher engagement (reviews and installs).
The price distribution shows that most paid apps are low-cost, with a few expensive outliers.
Google takes a 30% cut from paid apps, impacting revenue estimates.
